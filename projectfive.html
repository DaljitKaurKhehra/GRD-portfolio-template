				  <h1>The Patty Duke Awards Brand Suite</h1>
                <p>Through Slingshot, a remote internship that allows students to work with revenue-generating clients, I had the privilege of working with the Velma V. Morrison Center for their rebranding of the Idaho High School Theatre Awards, now known as the Patty Duke Awards. After two rounds of pitch processes, my logo was selected out of a pool of over a dozen designs from other interns. I was given the opportunity to create a brand suite of logos that would equip the Morrison Center with everything they needed to market this prestigious annual event for years to come. The Morrison Center wanted to rebrand The Idaho High School Theatre Awards to honour 60s actress Patty Duke’s legacy of philanthropy and acting, and her family foundation’s financial support of the annual event, while also appealing to today’s teens. My solution was a logo that incorporates Patty’s autograph, as if she were signing off on the event itself, which is complemented by sans serif to contrast the cursive. The black and gold palette, plus the shadow, insinuate the stage and spotlight. </p>
